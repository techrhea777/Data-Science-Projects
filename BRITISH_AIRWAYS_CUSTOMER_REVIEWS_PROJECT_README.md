# British Airways Data Science Project

This project focuses on utilizing data science techniques to analyze customer reviews and understand factors influencing buying behavior for British Airways. The project involves scraping and analyzing customer review data, building predictive models, and conducting sentiment analysis and topic modeling.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- wordcloud
- textblob
- scikit-learn

You can install them using pip:


## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
3. Run the provided scripts or notebooks to perform data analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.
4. Adjust the scripts as needed for your specific dataset or analysis requirements.

## Project Structure

- `reviews_data1.csv`: Dataset containing customer reviews.
- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data analysis.
- `sentiment_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for sentiment analysis.
- `topic_modeling.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for topic modeling.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Data Cleaning

Before performing analysis, ensure to clean the data. Sample cleaning steps include removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, and removing unnecessary whitespaces.

## Analysis

- **Data Analysis**: Explore the dataset, perform basic statistics, and visualize data distribution.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze sentiment polarity of reviews using TextBlob.
- **Topic Modeling**: Utilize Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify topics in the reviews.

## Results

- Sentiment Distribution: Visualize sentiment polarity distribution of reviews.
- Recommended vs. Not Recommended Reviews: Compare the count of recommended and not recommended reviews.
