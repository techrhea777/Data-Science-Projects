# Linear Regression Example

This repository contains an example of linear regression using synthetic data. The code demonstrates how to:

1. Create a simple dataset with two features and a target variable.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train a linear regression model on the training data.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
5. Optionally, print the coefficients and intercept of the trained model.
6. Predict target values for new data samples using the trained model.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 100 samples with two features (`Feature 1` and `Feature 2`) and a target variable. The target variable is generated based on a linear relationship with the features, with some added random noise.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn).
3. Run the provided Python script in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).

## Example Output

Upon running the script, the following outputs are generated:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the trained model on the test set.
- Coefficients and intercept of the trained linear regression model.
- Predicted prices for new data samples.
