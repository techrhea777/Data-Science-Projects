# Classification Examples in Machine Learning

This repository contains examples of different types of classification tasks in machine learning, implemented using Python and various libraries such as NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

## Binary Classification Task

This example demonstrates a binary classification task using synthetic data generated with `make_blobs` function from scikit-learn. It includes the following steps:

1. Generating a synthetic dataset with two classes.
2. Summarizing the dataset shape.
3. Counting the number of observations for each class.
4. Displaying the first few examples with their corresponding class labels.
5. Visualizing the dataset with a scatter plot colored by class label.

## Multi-Class Classification Task

This example illustrates a multi-class classification task using synthetic data created with `make_blobs` function from scikit-learn. The process involves:

1. Generating a synthetic dataset with three classes.
2. Summarizing the dataset shape.
3. Counting the number of observations for each class.
4. Displaying the first few examples with their corresponding class labels.
5. Visualizing the dataset with a scatter plot colored by class label.

## Multi-Label Classification Task

This section presents a multi-label classification task utilizing the `make_multilabel_classification` function from scikit-learn. It covers the following steps:

1. Generating a synthetic dataset with three labels.
2. Summarizing the dataset shape.
3. Displaying the first few examples with their corresponding labels.

## Imbalanced Data in Binary Classification

This example demonstrates an imbalanced binary classification task using synthetic data created with `make_classification` function from scikit-learn. It includes the following steps:

1. Generating a synthetic imbalanced dataset.
2. Summarizing the dataset shape.
3. Counting the number of observations for each class.
4. Displaying the first few examples with their corresponding class labels.
5. Visualizing the dataset with a scatter plot colored by class label.
