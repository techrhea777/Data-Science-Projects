# Image Processing Operations with OpenCV and Matplotlib

This repository contains Python code snippets demonstrating various fundamental image processing operations using OpenCV and Matplotlib in a Google Colab environment.

## Operations Included

1. **Displaying Different Channels of an RGB Image**: Load an RGB image and display its red, green, and blue channels separately.
2. **Converting an RGB Image to Grayscale**: Convert an RGB image to grayscale and display both the original RGB image and the converted grayscale image.
3. **Histogram Equalization**: Apply histogram equalization to enhance the contrast of an image.
4. **Contrast Stretching**: Perform contrast stretching to improve the contrast of an image.
5. **Sharpening the Image**: Apply sharpening to enhance the edges and details in an image.
6. **Image Segmentation Using Binary Thresholding**: Segment an image using binary thresholding.
7. **Morphological Operations**: Perform morphological operations such as erosion and dilation on an image.
8. **Opening and Closing Operations**: Perform opening and closing operations on an image.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or open it in Google Colab.
2. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.
3. Run each code snippet to perform the corresponding image processing operation.
4. Adjust the image paths as needed to use your own images for processing.

## Requirements

- Python
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

## Files

- `README.md`: This documentation file.
- `image_processing_operations.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code snippets for image processing operations.
- Sample images are not included in this repository. Please replace the image paths with your own images.
